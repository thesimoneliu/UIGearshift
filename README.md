# Get Started

### First, you need to get the server running on your local computer

1. Connect your computer to the WiFi
2. Download this file, or clone this file to your local computer
3. On your computer, open the terminal and direct to this file
4. In your terminal, run `npm install`
5. Then run `npx parcel build index.html`
6. You can now view the prototype live at http://localhost:8080

### Then, you can test this prototype in your targeted device (now Safari on iOS deviced only) following the steps below

1. Get your IP address (your-IP-address) from your computer,
2. Ensure your targeted uses the same WiFi as your computer does
3. Open Safari
4. Go to http://your-IP-address:8080

# Design Statement

This is a response to Tesla's 5-day coding challenge.

I started from discovery and research by looking at current Tesla test-drive and touchscreen videos. I am aware that this digital Gear-shifter needs designing closely related to the other elements of the screen such as the right-side view, the speed display, other elements' positions and etc, which might cause too much complexity if all taken into considerations. So I decided to focus only on the gear shifter itself that should be placed on the left side of the screen.
